# Is it my birthday?
This app has a very simple premise: Is today the user's birthday?

# Why?
The purpose of this app is an easy-to-make app which can be used to demonstrate
the basics of app development.

## V1
Version 1 of this app is a simple react native app which displays a message
based on whether or not today is the user's birthday after the user enters
their birthday (cached in local storage).

The goals of this app were to assess react native's approach to app development
and to learn the basics of react native. Additionally, this app was used to
learn the basics of deploying an app to the Google Play Store. The listing for
V1 of this app has been removed from the Google Play Store.

## V2
Version 2 of this app is a PWA with dedicated mobile apps for Android and iOS
created using the Ionic framework. At time of writing this README, v2 has
not yet been created.

### Goals
This app is being created to showcase the software architecture principles to
a group of students at a local high school. The goals of the app are to
demonstrate the following:
- The basics of app development
- The basics of software architecture
- The basics of software design
- The basics of software testing
- The basics of software deployment

And how all of these principles come together to create a software product.
Furthermore, this app will be used to demonstrate the complexities of
non-pure app development (i.e. app development which requires the use of
external services, and which is deployed to various platforms simultaneously).
